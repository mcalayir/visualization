# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
      ```
     Good example: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/co-emissions-per-capita
     
    I classify Our World in Data’s “CO₂ emissions per capita” chart as a good visualization because it is easy to read and helps people compare places over time.It helps a viewer answer common questions fast, like: Which countries are high? Which are low? Are emissions going up or down over time?

    -- Good chart type for the job. It uses a normal line chart with clear axes. People can compare values by looking at where the line sits on the same scale. This is usually easier and more accurate than judging shapes or angles(like in pie charts).

    -- Clear meaning. The chart tells you what is being measured (“CO₂ per person”) and shows units. That prevents confusion between “total emissions” and “per person” emissions.“Emissions per person” is a number that changes over years. A line chart is a normal and clear way to show change over time.

    -- Not too messy. It reduces misunderstanding by being specific. It clearly says this is per capita (per person). That matters because “total emissions” and “per person emissions” can tell very different stories.The chart description and labeling help avoid that confusion. This makes the main message (the data trend) stand out.

    How it could be improved:

    Make it easier for everyone to read(accessibility): make sure colors and text have strong contrast, and do not rely on color alone to show differences (markers can be used), and make sure text and lines have strong contrast.

    Adding vertical gridlines (label grids) can be better for comparing by year, as long as it stays light and thin and doesn’t make the chart messy.
    
    Bad example: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/lani.he/viz/WomeninNobelPrice/Dashboard

    I classify this as a bad visualization because it makes comparison and understanding harder than it needs to be.

    --Hard chart shape for the goal(radial design). The dashboard uses a circular/radial layout. Radial charts make people compare angles and curved distances. That is harder than comparing values on a straight line with one shared baseline. In many cases, a simple bar chart or line chart would be clearer for comparing categories and years.

    --Too much visual clutter. There are many rings, marks, and labels close together. This creates noise and makes it hard to see the main message quickly. Good practice is to reduce extra marks that don’t add meaning, so the data stands out.

    -- Weak labeling for exact reading. Viewers often need exact values (like percent). In this dashboard, it is not easy to read exact numbers without effort (for example, needing hover or guessing from the rings). Clear axes and direct labels help reduce guessing and reduce mistakes.

    -- Accessibility concerns. When a visualization depends on small marks and color differences, it can be difficult for color-blind viewers or people viewing on small screens. Accessibility guidance recommends not relying on color alone and using strong contrast and readable text.

    How it could be improved

    -- Switch to a simple chart type: Use a line chart (year on x-axis, percent on y-axis) with one line per Nobel category, or use small multiples (one mini-chart per category). This makes comparisons much easier.

    -- Reduce clutter: remove extra rings/ticks and limit decoration. Keep only what helps reading the data.

    -- Add direct labels: show key values (or end-of-line labels) so people don’t have to guess.

    -- Improve accessibility: use a colorblind-safe palette, stronger contrast, and larger text.
      
      ```
- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)
